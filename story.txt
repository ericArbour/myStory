I started walking down the street.
I saw a chicken.
Yay.
Yay is what I said...until I saw what was behind it.
Behind it stood a four foot replica of the statue of liberty.
But she was wearing a juggalo makeup.
I realized that this wasn't just a replica of the statue,
it was small man dressed in this attire!
"What is your name?" I asked the small man.
"Billy Ray Cyrus" He said.
"Bill Ray Cyrus?" I asked. "Yes, I am very deep undercover.
Their are terrorists here trying to steal the declaration
independence and I need your help!".
"Well, then, as you may know, my name just so happens to be Nicholas Cage", I said.
