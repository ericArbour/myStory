I started walking down the street.
I saw a chicken.
Yay.
Yay is what I said...until I saw what was behind it.
Behind it stood a four foot replica of the statue of liberty.
But she was wearing a juggalo makeup.
I realized that this wasn't just a replica of the statue,
it was small man dressed in this attire!
